# ObjectOrientedProject
 This will be a console application, specifically a vehicle showroom. The main purpose of this is simply to use the object oriented approach and to use the skills that I learned throughout the years.

 Class vs Object
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It serves as a template from which objects can be instantiated.
An object is an instance of a class. Each object in a class can have its own unique data.
OOP
OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on objects.
The 4 main pillars of OOP are:
1.	Abstraction
2.	Encapsulation
3.	Inheritance
4.	Polymorphism
Encapsulation: The main goal of encapsulation is to maintain data integrity and restriction through access modifiers.  The process is to hide all private data and show them only through properties or methods which are public. Access modifiers are (public, private, protected, internal). Then by means of public methods, for example getters and setters, the user is then allowed to get the required data as needed. 
Abstraction: Focuses on representing essential features and behaviors of the object, while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes, interfaces and contracts. Once you create an abstract class, and you create a child class which inherits from the abstract class, all the abstract methods has to be implemented in the child class. One must note that the methods inside the parent class are only assigned without a functionality.
Inheritance: Enables the user to create new classes that reuse, extend and modify the behavior defined in other classes. Allows a sub-class to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class called the superclass. This is good for code reusability and better code readability.
Polymorphism: This can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding. For example, a base class called animal has a virtual method called MakeSound (). The class dog inherits from the superclass called animal the method MakeSound() and overrides it and can do anything with it.
